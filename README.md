# Overview
This is a repository containing my solutions to the challenges found at [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/). 
I will be adding to this repository as I continue solving challenges, and as I learn better ways to do things.
I have included a significant amount of comments in my code to help you (and me in like 5 days) understand what's going on. Happy coding!

# Status
Legend: 
- ✅ : Challenge is considered **completed** in that language. This means that:
    - Source code achieves or exceeds the functionality specified in the challenge.
    - *All* tests are passing.

- ❌ : Challenge is considered **incomplete** in that language. This means that:
    - Source code is not fully functional;
    - Tests aren't passing/don't exist;

# Credits
I stand upon the shoulders of giants and here I credit them.

## People/Projects 
- A significant portion of the build system for these projects is based on the course content for [Modern C++ Course For CV (2020)](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/teaching/cpp-2020/lectures/index.html).
Although it might be unrecognisable from it now, I would still like to thank Ignacio Vizzo and the University of Bonn for providing incredibly high quality C++ content **for free**.
- I would also like to thank Yan Chernikov a.k.a "[TheCherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno)" for creating the best C++ reference tutorials on YouTube.
